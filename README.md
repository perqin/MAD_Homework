# MAD_Homework

Since Homework 5 project is merged to [MAD_Todo](https://github.com/perqin/MAD_Todo).

It is really **disgusting** to store the project directories of Cocos2d-x which take more than 2GB space for each, so I have to sync the necessary subfolders to this repo and remove the local ones.
